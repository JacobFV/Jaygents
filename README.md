# jaygets

Some personal reinforcement learning agent implimentations. The name comes from the phonetic abreviation of "Jacob's agents".

## Geting started

```
pip install jaygents
```

Note: you'll probabbly want to install in a separate virtual environment to avoid dependency issues. It ultimately only reuires `dm-sonnet` however.
